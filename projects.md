# Projects

Here’s a snapshot of some of my key work and concepts:

- **Týr Fyre Marketing Project**  
  A firearms safety marketing brand I built, emphasizing social media engagement, bold branding, and education.

- **MicroNano Blockchain Concept**  
  A proof-of-work cryptocurrency inspired by antimatter as a high-value store of energy, designed for use in very small quantities.

- **Additional Projects (Coming Soon)**  
  I plan to showcase other cybersecurity exercises, personal tech projects, and marketing campaigns here.
